- **Cleaned Dataset**: [Google Sheets - Heart Disease Research Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S8l53VDxbnpeuWB-tze9_HD5m9x4UVErm5c-ppX-hJI/edit#gid=0)


This project aims to explore the relationship between various factors and the likelihood of developing heart disease. Using logistic regression analysis, we investigate how factors such as BMI, sleep time, cholesterol levels, and potentially others, contribute to the risk of heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains cleaned data related to heart disease, including various demographic and health-related factors. Each observation in the dataset represents an individual, with heart disease status (0 or 1) indicating whether the individual has been diagnosed with heart disease.

## Analysis

The analysis primarily focuses on exploring the relationship between individual factors and the presence of heart disease using logistic regression models. We aim to identify factors that may be associated with an increased risk of heart disease, providing insights that could contribute to preventive measures and interventions.

### Logistic Regression Plots

- **BMI (Body Mass Index):**
  - Investigates the relationship between BMI and the likelihood of developing heart disease.

- **Sleep Time:**
  - Explores the impact of sleep duration on the risk of heart disease.

- **Cholesterol Levels:**
  - Analyzes the association between cholesterol levels and the probability of heart disease.

- **Additional Factors:**
  - Additional factors can be explored by extending the analysis and creating logistic regression plots for other relevant variables present in the dataset.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have access to the dataset containing cleaned heart disease data.
2. Execute the R code provided in this repository to perform logistic regression analysis and create plots.
3. Analyze the logistic regression plots to gain insights into the relationship between various factors and the likelihood of developing heart disease.
4. Use the insights obtained to develop preventive measures and interventions aimed at reducing the risk of heart disease.
